Idea 1:
A user logs into our service and uploads a picture or provides a keyword of interest. In the case of the image, we run it through an image classification service that will output a keyword with some confidence. We use that keyword to query the Reddit API and find subreddits and/or posts that might interest the user. We can manage the usersâ€™ subscriptions on their behalf and keep track of changes we have made through our database in the case that the user wants to keep track of/manage changes that our application has made. Depending on the success of previous barebones goals, we may want to add features to our dashboard that for example curate posts for the user.
