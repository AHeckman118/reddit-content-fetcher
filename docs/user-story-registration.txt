I, a user who isn’t logged into Reddit, want to sign up and get some recommendations for subreddits.  

To do this, I’ve found this web app and have tried to sign in.  

If I don’t have an account, it points me to Reddit to make one.  

If I do, I enter my login information and get taken to the Search story.  

If I enter my login information incorrectly, the app tells me and I am prompted to reenter it.
